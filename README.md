# p5.js + p5.asciify + Vite | JavaScript template

This is a template for a [`p5.js`](https://p5js.org/) project that uses the [`p5.asciify`](https://github.com/humanbydefinition/p5.asciify) add-on library. It is set up to use [`Vite`](https://vitejs.dev/) as the build tool.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.

2. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start a development server at `http://localhost:5173/` usually. When you make changes to the code, the server will automatically reload the page.

4. To build the project for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `dist` folder with the compiled project.
